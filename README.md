# useEffect Practice App

This React application demonstrates how to use the `useEffect` hook in a real-world context. It includes a form that auto-saves user input with a delay and a presentation component explaining how the logic works.

## Features

- React `useState` and `useEffect` Hooks
- Auto-saving form data to `localStorage`
- Debounce pattern with `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`
- Clean UI with responsive styling
- Slide-style presentation explaining the code

## Components

- `Bio.jsx`: A form where users can type their name, status, and bio. Data is auto-saved with a delay.
- `Presentation.jsx`: A walkthrough of how the form and `useEffect` hook function.
- `App.jsx`: Combines the `Bio` and `PresentationPage` components.
